**Project Description:** 

Program 1: 
Created main class to run the following using the method provided.
The diameter of the Sun is approximately 865,000 miles. The diameter of the Earth is
approximately 7600 miles. Use the methods in the class Math to calculate,
(a) the volume of the Earth in cubic miles
(b) the volume of the Sun in cubic miles
(c) the ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth
and then output the three values. Treat both the earth and sun as spheres. The volume of a
sphere is given by the formula 4 pi r^3/3 where r is the radius.

Program 2: 
Created a new program that has the following features. Download source (JAVA).
(a) Uses labeled continue instead of break.
(b) Does not require the isPrime variable.
(c) When testing whether an integer is prime, it is sufficient to try and divide by integers up to
the square root of the number being tested.

Program 3: 
Filled in the code that computes the number of spaces, vowels, and
consonants.

Program 4: 
Created a program that sets up a String variable with the soliloquy in the previous question,
extracts the words from the text and sorts them into alphabetical order. You may define
'words' however you wish (within reason), but provide your definition with your solution. You
can use the sorting method of your choice. The simplest one is the bubble sort, which works
as follows:
• Starting with the first element in the array compare successive elements (0 and 1, 1
and 2, 2 and 3, and so on).
• If the first element of any pair is greater than the second, interchange the two
elements.
• Repeat the process for the whole array until no interchanges are necessary. The array
elements will now be in ascending order.
• Run the program once you have written your code. Turn in your code, and the output
produced when the code runs. 

**Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code
